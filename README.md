# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! I'm Jarek , a bioinformatician by training and a passionate tinkerer by heart.  

🧬 By day, I analyze sequencing data and build bioinformatics pipelines.  
🎮 By night, I create random apps to scratch an itch or just for fun — like timers for League of Legends to track cooldowns using voice commands!

## 🌟 Projects

### 🧪 Bioinformatics & Science
- **[Master Thesis](https://github.com/Milithril/TNM-NGS)** —My MSc thesis on predicting kidney cancer TNM staging using machine learning models trained on gene expression (HTSeq count) data.
- **[Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/Milithril/C.A-ASF.git)** — My BSc thesis on cellular automata simulating epidemic of African Swine Fever.

### 🔌 Machine Learning <3
- **[Prediction of Polish Holstein’s](https://github.com/Milithril/Cow.git)** - My apporach in using Machine learnign to predict Economical Index & Calving Interval of a Cow.
- **[Prediction of Gecko Behaviour](https://github.com/Milithril/Geckos.git)**. - Our approach at usage of Machine learning algorythms to predict reaction of Gecko.

### 💡 Fun & Experimental Apps
- **[LoL Timer App](https://github.com/Milithril/LoL-timer.git)** — A simple voice-activated timer to track in-game cooldowns (because who wants to count seconds manually?).
- **[Among us Sherlock](https://github.com/JaroslawWoW/Among_Us_Sherlock.git)** - A compaion to help you catch those pesky SuS crewmates
- Maaaaaybe I will try making an assistant to Don't Starve Together : >
- *(More random tools and experiments coming soon!)*
